# to get a custom ROM image.

run customize-rom.sh

	OR

run modFiles.pl
remove the data directory if you want to start from scratch
run reget_files.sh to be sure you have all the files
run rm-files.sh to remove unwanted files (only removes for now)
run makerom.sh with "-d XdX" to write to the drive at /dev/XdX
		or
run makerom.sh without "-d" to just make a rom-partition file
