#  This file describes what the user has to do currently
# to get a custom ROM image.

edit custom.conf, staying strictly to the rules
remove the data directory if you want to start from scratch
run reget_files.sh to be sure you have all the files
run customize_rom.sh to remove unwanted files (only removes for now)
run makerom.sh with "-d XdX" to write to the drive at /dev/XdX
		or
run makerom.sh without "-d" to just make a rom-partition file
